### Description
The files in this folder contain counts of each possible motif configuration of size k in the hemibrain dataset. 

### Reproducability
These counts were generated by an algorithm proposed by Matejek et al. (2022). You can find the paper [here](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/edge-colored-directed-subgraph-enumeration-on-the-connectome). The code used to generate those results is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/rhoana/subgraph_enumeration).
