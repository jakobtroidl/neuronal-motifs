### Description

The files in this folder contain counts of each possible motif configuration of size k in the hemibrain dataset. Each
file contains a dictonary with the [networkx](https://networkx.org/) graph as a key and the count of this graph in the
hemibrain.

### Reproducability

These counts were generated by an algorithm proposed by Matejek et al. (2022). You can find the
paper [here](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/edge-colored-directed-subgraph-enumeration-on-the-connectome).
The code used to create those results is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/rhoana/subgraph_enumeration).
